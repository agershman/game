# Game

A simple web based multi-player game I developed during a Hackathon in 2013. Game server manages state, view is any web browser and control is based on motion from a mobile device.

To run:

1. `cd server`

2. `mise task run start`

3. `cd view`

4. `open game.html`

5. Use `phone` task to simulate phone control or `open control.html` on a device which supports the motion control API.
